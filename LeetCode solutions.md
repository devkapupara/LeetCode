### [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber)<a name="house-robber"></a>
```java
/*
The basic idea is that if you are robbing house i, the maximum loot may come from by robbing the i-2th house or by robbing the i-3th house. Therefore rob both and then find the path that gave the maximum profit.
Example: loot = [1,9,3,8,4,3,6,4,3,5,7,6]
Profit DP = [1,9,4,17,13,20,23,24,26,29,33,35]
Here,

	dp[4] = loot[4] + max(dp[2], dp[1])
	dp[5] = loot[5] + max(dp[3], dp[2]) and so on.
In the end, just compare the last two elements to check which path gave us the maximum profit.
Some people might not prefer modifying the original nums array. In that case, you can initialize another dp array of same length, initialize the first two elements as dp[0] = nums[0] and dp[1] = nums[1] and dp[3] = nums[0] + nums[2] and then performing the same loop. In that case, you would be using O(n) space.

### [kth Largest Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)<a name="kth-largest-element"></a>
1.	The minheap algorithm has $O(n lg n) $ complexity and $O(1)$ space. The idea here is that we use a minheap to keep only the k greatest elements. If size becomes more than k, we remove the smallest element at the top of the heap. Thereby, at the end, our kth largest element will be at the top.
2.	QuickSelect Algorithm performs in $O(n)$ best case, $O(n^2)$ worst case when the pivot chosen is always the largest, so we use a random pivot.

### [Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)<a name="arranging-coins"></a>
The idea is as follows. Sum of first n numbers is given by $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$. We need to find $n$ such that sum of $n$ numbers is closest to the number of coins we have. That is, $\frac{n^2+n}{2} = k$ where $k$ is the number of coins we have. So, everything boils down to solving the quadratic equation $n^2 + n - 2k = 0$. We use the quadratic formula where for any quadratic equation $ax^2 -bx + c$ is solved substituting for $a$, $b$ and $c$ in $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2}$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are always going to be 1, while $c$ is always going to be $2k$. Substitute those, and solve the equation.

```java
public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
    // return solveQuadratic(n);
    return iterative(n);
}

private int solveQuadratic(int n){
    return (int)(Math.sqrt(1 + 8*(long)n)-1)/2;
}

private int iterative(int n){
    int used = 1, level = 0;		// Coins used, and level completed.
    while (n > 0){					// While coins left are greater than 0.
        n-=used;					// Calculcate remaining coins.
        if (n > -1)					// If there are still some coins left,
            ++level;				// we were able to fill the level.
        ++used;						// Prepare used for the next level, which is plus 1.

### [String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)<a name="string-compression"></a>

- Runtime: 1ms, beats 99.65%
- Space: 43.30MB, beats 98.11%

Variables:

- `arrayIndex` to keep track of the compressed string built so far
- `idx` to keep track of current index in the `chars` array

Logic

- Traverse the full string once using `idx` to keep track of current character
- Count how many characters occur in a sequence until a break
- We will overwrite the `chars` array by using `arrayIndex` to keep track of the current index to write to
- Write the character first
- Then determine if count is greater than 1
- If less than 10, then just convert the number to character and write it to `chars` increasing the `arrayIndex`
- If greater than 10, then we will need to write all the digits in the array, so that's what we are doing.
- Return the `arrayIndex` once done.

```java
public int compress(char[] chars) {
      int arrayIndex = 0;
      int idx = 0;
      while (idx < chars.length) {
          int count = 0;

```java
/**
The idea is simple. For each number in the array, since it's gauranteed that that the values
lie are inclusive [1,n], we can look at the index value-1. So check that index, and mark
that value as negative. That is why I take the absolute value. Check value at that index, if
negative, it means we have visited it via some other duplicate value. But if it's positive,
then we are seeing it for the first time, so make it's value negative. Make a second pass.
For values that are still positive, that means those indices were never visited, hence left
positive. So add 1 to them and add it to the set. Eg:
	Given array a = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1],
1.	val = 4 => idx = 3 & a[3] > 0, therefore, a[3] *= -1
	a = [4,3,2,-7,8,2,3,1]
2.	val = 3 => idx = 2 & a[2] > 0, therefore a[2] *= -1
	a = [4,3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]
3.	val = -2 => idx = abs(-2)-1 = 1 & a[1] > 0, therefore a[1] *= -1
	a = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]
4.	val = -7 => idx = abs(-7)-1 = 6 & a[6] > 0, therfore a[6] *= -1
	a = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,1]
5.	val = 8 => idx = abs(8)-1 = 7 & a[7] > 0, therfore a[7] *= -1
	a = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
6.	val = 2 => idx = 1 but a[2] < 0. No change.
7.	val = -3 => idx = abs(-3)-1 = 2 but a[2] < 0. No change.
8.	val = -1 => idx = abs(-1)-1 = 0 & a[0] > 0, therefore a[0] *= -1
	a = [-4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
Observation: Notice index 4 and 5 have positive values, since those values were never
encountered, so the values at those indexes never became negative. Hence missing values are
5 and 6.

This problem is phrased poorly and I had to read the comments by other users to understand what it required from me. The link I marked here explains the logic pretty good. But the simple logic is this: The number of rounds $r = \frac{Total Test Time}{Minutes To Die} +1$. Each pig has chances of dying in each round or staying alive till the end, so we plus 1. Now given the number of rounds $r$ and the number of samples $s$, how many volunteers $v$ will you need? $r^v = s$. Each round has some volunteers which in total at the end should be able to test out all the samples. Therefore, $v =\log_rs$.

```java
public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
    int base = minutesToTest/minutesToDie+1;		// How many rounds can you perform?
    return (int)Math.ceil(Math.log(buckets)/Math.log(base));

### [Repeated Substring Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/submissions/)<a name="repeated-substring-pattern"></a>
We use the [KMP Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/) that allows us to match a string 's' with another string 'p' to find the longest sequence of characters in 's' that match 'p'. We can use a Naive Pattern match where we start from the beginning of the string and start comparing the characters of 's' with 'p'. Initially, we keep the partition at index 0. If the character's match, we move partition to the right by 1 till we get to the end of the string. If something doesn't match, we don't move the partition but look at the next character to match. In the end, wherever the partition is, that's our longest length we could match with string 'p'. The complexity of that is <i>O(len(p)(len(s)-len(p)+1))</i>.

KMP fixes it by skipping characters that we know already match. In this problem, we aren't matching with any other string but itself. So, we start from index 1 of the string and compare it from the beginning. If they match, we increase j by 1, note it down in lps array and then increase i by 1 to check the next character. j basically measures the longest chain of characters we were able to match. If we couldn't match character at index i and if streak was greater than 0, then our new streak becomes whatever it was in the previous round of matching characters. If the streak is 0, then we simply note down at index i in our lps array 0, meaning longest length measured upto index i was 0. 

```java
public boolean repeatedSubstringPattern(String s) {
        int maxLength = lps(s);
        return maxLength > 0 && s.length() % (s.length() - maxLength) == 0;
    }

private int lps(String s){
    int len = s.length();
    int[] lps = new int[len];
    int i = 1;		// To match the string with itself.
    int j = 0;
    while (i < len){
        if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)){	// if the chars match
            lps[i] = ++j;					// we record that # of matches at index i was
            ++i;							// 1+j and increment i to check next character
        }
        else{								// character did not match
            if (j > 0)						// If our matching streak > 0
                j = lps[j-1];				// our new streak becomes the previous round's streak
            else							// Otherwise, streak is already 0.
                lps[i++] = 0;				// So we record that # of matches made at i is 0
        }									// We increment i to check next index.
    }
    return lps[len-1];						// Longest prefix length that was also a suffix
}											// is whatever was recorded at the end of array.

### [Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)<a name="island-perimeter"></a>
The idea is simple. Count the number of cells with value 1 which denotes the land. Check towards the left and up to that cell and check if it shares any edge with another cell with value 1. If it does record that. In the end, the formula for perimeter is 4 * (the number of land cells) - 2 * (overlapping edges).

**Reasoning:** Perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of it's side. Here all squares are of length 1. So total perimeter is 4*(number of cells with value = 1). But we also need to account the edges that are common between two adjacent land cells. If one square shares an edge with another, we just lost one side from both the square, resulting in a loss of two sides. Therefore, we need to subtract twice the number of overlapping edges from the total perimeter to get  the total perimeter. 

```java
public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
    int land = 0;
    int overlap = 0;
    for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; ++row)
        for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; ++col){
            if (grid[row][col] == 1){
                ++land;
                if (row-1 > -1 && grid[row-1][col] == 1)	// Check above the current cell.
                    ++overlap;		// If it's a land, we need to record one overlap.
                if (col-1 > -1 && grid[row][col-1] == 1)	// Similarly, check to the left.
                    ++overlap;		// If it's a land, we need to increment overlap
            }
        }
    return 4*land - 2*overlap;		// Check the reasoning above.
}
```



### [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)<a name="number-complement"></a>
```java
public int findComplement(int num) {
    int pow2 = 1;				// Easily keep track of power of 2.
    int comp = 0;				// Complement number
    while (num != 0){			// Since num gets divided by 2, it will be 0 in the end.
        int bit = num % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0;	// If bit is 0 then complement is 1 & vice versa.
        comp += bit * pow2;		// Multiply it by the appropriate power of 2 and add to comp
        pow2 *= 2;				// Update power of 2 for next iteration.
        num /= 2;				// Divide num by 2 to get the next bit.
    }
    return comp;				// Comp is now the complement.
}
```



### [Binary Watch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/)<a name="binary-watch"></a>
The idea is as follows. We have 10 lights. First 4 represent hours. Namely 1, 2, 4 and 8, which are the first four powers of 2. The next 6 lights, represent minutes. Those are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. These are powers of 2 from 0-5. So if we iterate from 1 to 9, powers of numbers 1-3 gives us hours and powers of numbers 4-9 minus 4 gives us minutes. So, if we have, let's say 2 lights, we need to find every combination of 2 lights. So in our helper function, we iterate from 1-9 to check every hour and minute combination. We also need to keep a track of the lights that we used, so we don't use the same light again. If hours are > 11 or minutes are > 59, we have an invalid time and we can abort. If the number of lights are 0, that means we found a valid time and we should add it to the result. Now, if the lights are not 0, then we need to check every possible combination from the last light used to 9. If i < 4, then we are looking at an hourly combination, otherwise it's a minute combination. So we recurse with updated lights used, decrease the numOfLights since we used one, update respective hours or minutes until we hit base case.

```java
List<String> result;

public List<String> readBinaryWatch(int num) {
    result = new ArrayList<>();
    helper(0, num, 0, 0);
    return result;
}

private void helper(int lightsUsed, int numOfLights, int hrs, int min){
    if (hrs > 11 || min > 59)		// Base case. Invalid time
        return;

    if (numOfLights == 0){			// All lights used, so add time to the list.
        result.add(hrs + ":" + (min < 10 ? "0" + min : min));
        return;
    }
    for (int i = lightsUsed; i < 10; i++){	// Otherwise start recursing from number of prev
        if (i < 4)							// light used. i < 4 means hours
            helper(i+1, numOfLights-1, hrs + (int)Math.pow(2, i), min);
        else								// i = [4,9] means minute. So recurse.
            helper(i+1, numOfLights-1, hrs, min + (int)Math.pow(2,i-4));
    }
}
```



### [Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements/)<a name="minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements"></a>
This was an interesting problem. But after working out a few examples by hand, you can notice that it is always a question of bringing the minimum element in par with everyone. So if you know the minimum of the array, we can check how many steps it will take to bring the minimum in par with other element by calculating the distance between them. For example,

> Let the array be [1,2,3]
>
> We can observe that the minimum here is 1. Let us list down all steps to make all elements equal.
>
> 1. [2,2,4], Keeping the second element fixed. Notice that distance between the element where 1 was and where 3 was is till the same.
> 2. [3,3,4], Keeping the last element fixed.
> 3. [4,4,4], Keeping last element fixed.
>
> Here, we first tried to make 1 equal to it's neighbor, which required us 1 step. Now, once it becomes equal to 1, the problem is how to make the last element in the original array, which is 3 equal to 1. It requires 2 steps, resulting in a total of of 3. The reason is that the moment you decide to increment the minimum element to match the next element, you fix the neighboring element and have to increment everything else. This will make the minimum and its neighbor the same, but it will also keep the distance between the minimum and all other elements the same because we just incremented everything. 
>
> So, the total number of moves required is the distance between the elements of the array and the minimum.

```java
public int minMoves(int[] nums){
    int min = nums[0];
    for (int i: nums)
        if (i < min)
            min = i;
    int moves = 0;
    for (int i: nums)
        moves += i-min;
    return moves;
}
```

> Now the above solution required two passes of the array. Can we do even better? Notice that in the end, all we are doing is finding the min and subtracting min from all the elements in the array. That means we are subtracting min *n* times where n is the length of the array. Why *n* times? Because there are *n* elements in the array. Shouldn't it be *(n-1)* times? No, because the distance of the min from min is 0. So we need to subtract min from itself too, so *n* times. We can achieve this by first calculating the total of the array while simultaneously keeping track of the minimum. Once done, all we need to do is subtract min *n* times from the sum, which is equivalent to subtracting min from each element. This results in a much overall better algorithm, requiring only 1 pass of the array.

```java
public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
    int sum = 0, min = nums[0];
    for (int i: nums){
        sum += i;
        if (i < min)
            min = i;
    }
    return sum - min*nums.length;
}
```



### [License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)<a name="license-key-formatting"></a>
The idea is simple. 

1. I maintain a temporary array *s* that contains only the characters in string *S* after converting them to uppercase.
2.  I maintain a variable *length* that counts how many characters I found in the string *S*. If length is 0, that means it contains only dashes (-). 
3. Then I record the *offset*. *Offset* basically measures how many characters of the String *S* will be grouped unevenly in the beginning part of the string. I can check that by using the modulus operator and finding out the remainder. That many characters (of *length < K*) will be in the beginning part of the string.
4. Next step is to calculate how many dashes I will need. It's basically *length / K*.
5. Then I create the char array that will hold the characters of the formatted key. It's length will be number of characters + the dashes we will need. We need to take care of a special case here. If the *offset* is 0, meaning I was able to divide characters in equal group, I need to subtract 1. Eg, let's say we had 8 characters and *K* was 4.  dashes = 8 / 4 = 2. We can divide 8 characters equally into 2 groups using only 1 dash. But since dashes was 2, it is clearly off by 1. This is the case when *offset* is 0.
6. *kIndex* tracks where character is to be inserted in the key array.
7. *used* tracks how many characters of the array *s*, which indirectly holds the characters of String *S*, are used.
8. First I copy down the characters of length *offset*. Because those are the ones of uneven length. *kIndex* and *used* variables are updated.
9. Last thing to do is to use all the remaining characters in array *s*, but we take *K* characters at a time, because we know that the segments are going to be of equal length. We also need to insert '-' after each segment, but only if *kIndex* is not at the beginning or at the end of the key array, because inserting it at those points is invalid.
10. Create a new string and return it.

```java
public String licenseKeyFormatting(String S, int K) {
    char[] s = new char[S.length()];
    int length = 0;
    for (char c: S.toCharArray())
      if (c != '-')
        s[length++] = Character.toUpperCase(c);
    if (length == 0)
        return "";
    int offset = length % K;
    int dashes = length / K; 
    char[] key = new char[length + dashes + (offset == 0 ? -1 : 0)];
    int kIndex = 0;
    int used = 0;
    while (used < offset)
      key[kIndex++] = s[used++];
    while (used < index){
      if (kIndex > 0 && kIndex < key.length)
        key[kIndex++] = '-';
      for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i)
        key[kIndex++] = s[used++];
    }
    return new String(key);
}
```



### [Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)<a name="max-consecutive-ones"></a>
Solution 1: I came up with this solution initially. 4 ms runtime and passes 99.97% submissions.

```java
public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
    int start = 0;					// Keep track of start of a streak, if any
    int max = 0;					// max length of the streak
    while (start < nums.length){	// While we are not at the end of the array
        if (nums[start] == 1){		// Check if we have a 1 at start, if so
            int streak = 0;			// initialize streak and check how long can we continue
            while (start < nums.length && nums[start] == 1){	// that streak.
                ++streak;			// Increment streak and left for each consecutive 1
                ++start;			// make sure you don't forget that start < nums.length
            }						// before checking nums[start] to prevent out-of-bounds
            if (streak > max)		// Check if the current streak is better than the
                max = streak;		// previous streak.
        }
        ++start;					// Increment start in either case to check for new
    }								// streaks.
    return max;
}
```



Solution 2: After analyzing the problem further, I noticed that 0 denotes the end of a streak. If we observe 1, we increment streak by 1. But if I see a 0, I reset my streak to 0. This solution too had a 4 ms runtime and passed 99.97% submissions.

```java
public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
    int max = 0;				// Global max streak
    int streak = 0;				// Local max streak.
    for (int i: nums){			// For each number in nums
        if (i == 1){			// If we see a 1
            ++streak;			// increment our ongoing streak.
            if (streak > max)	// If the local streak > global max
                max = streak;	// update global max streak.
        }
        else					// otherwise we just saw a 0.
            streak = 0;			// So our streak resets to 0.
    }
    return max;					// return the global max streak.
}
```



### [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)<a name="permutations"></a>
The idea is as follows. Given an array a = {1,2,3}, we want to generate all it's possible combinations. What we are trying to do here is that we first take the element at index 0, and find permutations of the remaining thing. When we do that, we insert the element at index 0 in front of the list to get 1 permutation. Similarly, we then take the element at index 1, and permute the remaining contents of the array and insert the element at index 1 in the beginning of the array to get another permutation and so on. In this problem, we are asked to return a list of list, so we first copy the numbers of the array into an ArrayList. Let's run this code for the above example.

> Given nums = {1,2,3}, our ArrayList will be the same, al = [1,2,3]. Our result list is empty, result = [] and index = 0.

### [Construct the Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/)<a name="construct-the-rectangle"></a>
The idea is very simple. We just need to iterate from width = sqrt(area) to 1 and check if area is perfectly divisible by width. If at any point, width is divisible, then that must be our minimum difference length and width, because we are diverging from the center on both sides. Width decreases while length keeps increasing. Think of it like this, for area = 24, we have many factors of 24, namely 1, 2, 3,4, 6, 8, 12, 24. It's sqrt when rounded down is 4. So we check for width = 4, is 24 perfectly divisible by 4? Yes, so divide it and whatever you get is going to be the minimal difference values. Suppose 4 and 6 weren't the factors for 24. In that case we decrease width by 1, which is 3. Check again, is 24 divisible by 3. Yes? Then that must be our answer. We are diverging away from the center on both sides equally, width to the left towards 1 and length to the right towards area . Therefore the moment we find one value that divides area perfectly, that's our required values.

```java
public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
    int[] dimensions = {area, 1};		// We know that if nothing works out, n*1 is always
    boolean done = false;				// going to be the answer
    int width = (int)Math.sqrt(area);	// We only need to check width from sqrt(area)
    while (!done){						// While not done
        if (area % length == 0){		// check if area is perfectly divisible by width
            dimensions[0] = width;		// if so, we found our width and the length.
            dimensions[1] = area/width;
            done = true;				// mark done as false
        }
        --width;						// otherwise decrease the length
    }
    return dimensions;					// return the dimensions found.

### [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)<a name="merge-intervals"></a>

public List<Interval> merge(List<Interval> intervals) {
    if (intervals == null || intervals.size() < 2)

													// compare adjacent intervals.
    List<Interval> merged = new ArrayList<>();

        else{										// otherwise it does.
            last.end = last.end > i.end ? last.end : i.end;	// So check which has greater end time, and make the last added interval's time equals that
            merged.set(merged.size()-1, last);		// And set it as the last added interval

### [Merged sorted lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)<a name="merged-sorted-lists"></a>
1. counterA keeps track of which element we are looking at in array 'a'. Same with counterB
2. counterK keeps track of where to insert the element in array 'a', since a has enough space. The problem states that it might have more than enough space, so we use only the spaces we need, which is the total of both their sizes. Since indexing in an array is 0-based, we subtract 1.
3. We insert elements from the end, since the end part of 'a' is empty. We can insert from the front, but then we would need to shift elements to the right after each insertion from 'b'.
4. If array values are equal, add them to the end, and decrease both their counter to check new values in the next iteration
5. If not equal, then check which one is greater, since the last part of the array should contain larger values. Whichever's greater, put it in 'a' at index 'counterA' and decrement the respective counter.
6. In the end, we might have some leftover elements either from 'a' or 'b' because we only process elements that are equal to the **min(size(a), size(b))**, until we run out of elements in one of the array. So, whichever array has elements pending, add it to the front of the array and return a.

```java
public int[] merge(int[] a, int sizeA, int[] b, int sizeB)
{
    int counterA = sizeA-1, counterB = sizeB-1, counterK = sizeA+sizeB-1;
    while (counterA > -1 && counterB > -1){
        if (a[counterA] == b[counterB]){
            a[counterK--] = a[counterA--];
            a[counterK--] = b[counterB--];
        }
        else
            a[counterK--] = a[counterA] > b[counterB] ? a[counterA--] : b[counterB--];
    }
    while (counterA > -1)
        a[counterK--] = a[counterA--];

### [Relative Ranks](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/)<a name="relative-ranks"></a>
The idea employed here is simple. We need to store the relative ranks in sorted order. We can sort the array for that, but that is O(n log n). We can do better than that by finding the relative rank in linear time. First we find the maximum score in the array and create another array of length = maxScore + 1. We add 1 so that when we see the maxScore in the nums, we can assign it to maxScore index. Once we have done that, now we iterate over the nums array. Variable i keeps track of what rank to assign. We check a value in the array and at that index in our reverse sorted array, we put i+1, which basically marks it's rank based on it's position in the rankings. Some of then indexes would be default, that is a score of 0. We then check each value in the descend array and if it's not 0, we assign it a rank, but not if the ranks are 1, 2 or 3. In that case, we assign it a special value of Gold, SIlver or Bronze.

```java
public String[] findRelativeRanks(int[] nums) {
    int maxScore = nums[0];
    for (int n: nums)
        if (n > maxScore)
            maxScore = n;
    int[] descend = new int[maxScore+1];
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i)
        descend[nums[i]] = i+1;
    String[] result = new String[nums.length];
    int rank = 1;
    for (int i = descend.length-1; i > -1; --i){
        int idx = descend[i];
        if (descend[i] != 0){
            if (rank == 1)
                result[idx-1] = "Gold Medal";
            else if (rank == 2)
                result[idx-1] = "Silver Medal";
            else if (rank == 3)
                result[idx-1] = "Bronze Medal";
            else
                result[idx-1] = rank + "";

### [Longest Uncommon Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/)<a name="longest-uncommon-subsequence-i"></a>
This is those kind of problems that shouldn't be up there. The problem is stated rather poorly and the solution is even stupider. All you are checking for is if the two string's aren't the same, then whichever one has a larger length is essentially the longest uncommon subsequence because the other string cannot form the full string. I know, it's stupid.

```java
  public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
      if (a.equals(b))
          return -1;
      return a.length() > b.length() ? a.length() : b.length();
  }

### [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)<a name="course-schedule-ii"></a>
This is a graph problem where we require to sort the vertices topologically. There are two choices we have for sorting topologically - Depth First Search approach based on finshing times or the Kahn's Algorithm. I have used Kahn's algorithm in this solution. Runtime is 2ms [beats 100%] and uses 45.3 MB space [beats than 90.16%]. The idea for Kahn's is simple - Enqueue all the nodes which has 0 incoming edges because those are the ones that can be started first. Then while the queue isn't empty, remove one node at a time, process it's outgoing nodes and decrease their indegrees by one. The reasoning behind that is let's say Node 2 has two prerequisites, Node 0 and Node 1. Node 0 and Node 1 have 0 indegrees. So our first two nodes would be Node 1 and Node 0 and if they are finished, then their outgoing Nodes can be started, that is Node 2. Now when you decrease any node's indegree and they become zero, add them to the queue because they can now be started. Keep doing this until the queue is empty.

In my approach, I'm avoiding any unnecessary data structure and using only the most basic ones like array's. So instead of using the queue, what I do is fill the array `order` which also stores the topological order. `idx` keeps track of the last index available to fill in the array. `start` mimics the `poll` behaviour of a queue. `while (start != idx)` makes sure that while we still have nodes to process, remove the one that can be started and decrease all the indegrees of outgoing edges.

```java
public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
    int[] indegrees = new int[numCourses];				// We maintain each node's indegree
    List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];	// Each node's outgoing edges
    for (int[] edge: prerequisites) {					// Process each edge
        indegrees[edge[0]]++;							// Update indegrees
        if (graph[edge[1]] == null)						// Also store the edge in graph
            graph[edge[1]] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
    }
    int[] order = new int[numCourses];		    // We don't technically need a queue.
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i)        // Find all nodes who indegree is 0
        if (indegrees[i] == 0)                  // and put them in the order array
            order[idx++] = i;
    int start = 0;                              // start tracks node to be polled.
    while (start != idx) {                      // while we can poll the queue
        int u = order[start++];                 // poll the node u
        if (graph[u] != null)                   // If node u has outgoing edges 
            for (int out: graph[u])             // Then for each of those nodes
                if (--indegrees[out] == 0)      // decrease their indegrees and check if it's 0
                    order[idx++] = out;         // if it's 0, add it to our queue (order)
    }
    if (idx != numCourses)						// Cycle check. If our idx != numCourses then
        return new int[] {};					// not all nodes could be processed. So we have
    return order;								// a cycle. Otherwise return our order array.
}

---

How do we count numbers? 16, 17, 18, 19 and then what? 20 right? We see that the last number is 19, we can't go past 9 so we set it to 0 and then increment the precedding digit to get 20. The idea is the same for this problem too. We keep a `levels` array to keep track of which character do we take from which number's allowed alphabet letters. For example, let's say the input string is `23`. Our `levels` array would `[0, 0]` in the beginning. This says pick characters at index 0 and 0 from alphabet characters corresponding to 2 and 3 which gives us `ad`. Then, we increase the last most counter in our levels array by 1 giving us `[0, 1]`. This allows us to get `ae` in the next iteration and levels array would be `[0, 2]`. We get `af` and levels array becomes `[0, 3]`. Now this is where it becomes interesting. We are only allowed three letters for the digit corresponding to 3 and since we already used all of them , we now need to shift to the next character for digit 2, which is `b`. Level array looks like `[1, 0]`. This will allow us to get `[b,e]`. So you get the rough idea now. Only thing now is we watch out when to stop. We stop when we have utilized all available characters from the 0th index's number's allowed alphabet letters. In this case, we stop when levels array look like `[3, 0]`.

```java
class Solution {
	private char[][] map = {
            {'a', 'b', 'c'},        // 2
            {'d', 'e', 'f'},        // 3
            {'g', 'h', 'i'},        // 4
            {'j', 'k', 'l'},        // 5
            {'m', 'n', 'o'},        // 6

            {'t', 'u', 'v'},        // 8
            {'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'}    // 9
    };

    private List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();                // Maintain the list of combinations

### [Bulls and Cows](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/)<a name="bulls-and-cows"></a>

Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Bulls and Cows.

Memory Usage: 36.3 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Bulls and Cows.

The idea is simple, first record the frequency of the digits of the secret number. Then we first find number of `bulls` by checking for exact indices match. After that we start to record the number of `cows`. The way we do is by again iterating over the `guess` string; only if there was a character mismatch and we still have the character available from `freq` table, we have a `cow`. Update it and decrement the frequency of the number we just used up.

```java
public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
    int bulls = 0;
    int cows = 0;
    int[] freq = new int[10];							// Freq of available digits from secret
    for (int i = 0; i < guess.length(); ++i) {
        char s = secret.charAt(i);
        freq[s - '0']++;								// Record the freq of the digit
        if (s == guess.charAt(i)) {						// If it's a match, we have a bulls.
            bulls++;
            freq[s - '0']--;							// We just used the character, so decrement it.
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < guess.length(); ++i) {
        int s = secret.charAt(i) - '0';					// Convert the chars into int
        int g = guess.charAt(i) - '0';
        if (s != g && freq[g] > 0) {					// Only if they are a mismtach and we have a number g available in freq table
            cows++;										// then it's a cow.
            freq[g]--;									// We used up the number, so decrement it's freq.
        }
    }
    
    return new StringBuilder().append(bulls).append("A").append(cows).append("B").toString();

Memory Usage: 37.6 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for N-Queens.

The idea is same as sudoku, but insteading of scanning rows, we scan columns. Start with row 0, column 0 and see if we can place a queen there, if yes place it and try the next cell of row 0 by recursing. We can't put the queen in the same row again, so we keep changing rows with column 1 until we find somewhere to place it. Keep doing this until you were successfully able to place all the queens as checked by the condition `col == n`. If so, add that solution to our list of accepted solutions.

```java
public class NQueens {

    private int[][] board;
    private int n;
    private List<List<String>> result;

    public List<List<String>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        this.n = n;
        board = new int[n][n];
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        solve(0);
        return result;
    }

    private boolean solve(int col) {

                    return true;
                }
                else

            list.add(sb.toString());
        }
        result.add(list);
    }

### [K-diff pairs in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array/)<a name="k-diff-pairs-in-an-array"></a>

Pretty intuitive solution. Build a frequency HashMap for all the numbers in the array. In a special case where `diff` is 0, just count occurences in our `freq` map whose values are 2 or more. In other case, just loop through all the keys and make sure it's supplement exists to count the number of K-diff pairs.

```java
public int findPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
    if (k < 0)
        return 0;
    int pairs = 0;
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i: nums) {
        freq.put(i, freq.getOrDefault(i, 0)+1);
    }
    if (k == 0) {
        for (int i: freq.values())
            if (i > 1)
                pairs++;
        return pairs;
    }
    for (int i: freq.keySet()) {
        if (freq.containsKey(i+k))
            pairs++;
    }
    return pairs;
}

### [Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)<a name="minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst"></a>

The idea is to use the Inorder traversal of a BST. We repeatively iterate over the left branch to find the minimum diff and then do the same for the right branch, but this time we already know that the parent of the right branch has to be its minimum, so first set it and then traverse the right branch to find the minimum difference.

```java
int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;								// Hold the minimum difference.
int prev = Integer.MAX_VALUE;								// Holds the minimum value observed for the right branch

public int getMinimumDifference(TreeNode root) {
    traverse(root);											// Start iterating from the root.
    return res;
}

private void traverse(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null)										// Null node, so stop recursion
        return;
    traverse(node.left);									// Keep traversing till the end of the tree
    res = Math.min(Math.abs(node.val-prev), res);			// Check if we have a minimum, if so set it.
    prev = node.val;										// The smallest value for the right branch is it's parent
    traverse(node.right);									// Set it first and then traverse.
}
```

### [BST Tree to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/)<a name="bst-tree-to-greater-tree"></a>

The idea is simple. In a BST, we know everything on the right side of a node is greater than it and it's left side. So when we are at any node, it's value would be its value + sum of everything on its right side. So, we first compute the node's value and then notice that the value for the node on the left is nothing but its value + parents value. So the node's value is computed, do the same thing for the left side, but this time, the starting sum would be the parent's value.


```java
public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
    traverse(root, 0);
    return root;
}

private int traverse(TreeNode node, int sum) {
    if (node == null)
        return sum;
    node.val += traverse(node.right, sum);
    return traverse(node.left, node.val);
}
```

          if (c == 'A') {								// If c is A, increment A
              A++;
              if (A > 1)								// If A is more than 1, return false
                  return false
              L = 0;										// Always set L count to 0
          }
          else if (c == 'L') {					// If c is L,
              L++;											// We might have consecutive L's, so start counting
              if (L > 2) {							// If we have more than 2 consecutive L's
                  return false;					// return false
              }
          }
          else													// Lastly, we might have a P, that will reset our

### [Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)<a name="binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal"></a>

The idea here is simple. We perform a BFS as usual using a Queue but I maintain a variable called `dir` to check which side do I add from. `dir=1` means add from Right->Left and `dir=-1` means add from usual Left->Right. I am also using LinkedList because of easy addition of elements in both direction. When I need to add from Right->Left, I use the `addFirst(E e)` method of LinkedList to add to the head, otherwise normal add to the tail. One important thing to take care of at each iteration is to know how many nodes to dequeue, hence the usage of the variable `children`. This allows me to keep track of how many children were added to the queue at each stage so I dequeue exactly that many children in the next stage. Apart from that, everything is straightforward.

```java
public List<List<Integer>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode root) {
      List<List<Integer>> list = new LinkedList<>();
      if (root == null)
          return list;
      Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
      q.add(root);										// Children = 1 because only root is added.
      int dir = 1, children = 1;			// Added the root, so next time dir = 1 (Right->Left)
      while(!q.isEmpty()) {
          int pushed = 0;
          LinkedList<Integer> l = new LinkedList<>();
          for (int i = 0; i < children; ++i) {		// Poll only those nodes that were queued in
              TreeNode u = q.poll();							// the previous stage.
              if (dir == 1)
                  l.add(u.val);
              else
                  l.addFirst(u.val);							// Left->Right add
              if (u.left != null) {								// Add children, notice I am counting here
                  q.add(u.left);									// how many children I am pushing/queuing
                  ++pushed;												// to the queue
              }
              if (u.right != null) {							// Same thing for right child.
                  q.add(u.right);
                  ++pushed;
              }
          }
          list.add(l);														// Add this list to main list
          children = pushed;											// update # of children pushed
          dir = dir == 1 ? -1: 1;									// update dir for next iteration

      }

Runtime: 3 ms, faster than 99.90% of Java online submissions for Array Partition I.

Memory Usage: 40.1 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Array Partition I.

I originally came up with the sorting solution where you sort the array and look at two numbers at a time and keep the smaller number out of them and add to the sum. It was way slower, so I checked the fastest submission and this one is pretty smart. The idea is really good. We know there are going to be 20,001 numbers, so reserve an array for it. Now let's say we had duplicates in our array, ex [1,2,1,4,1,1], if we were to sort it, we would get [1,1,1,1,2,4]. Notice that those four 1's don't really matter because each of them pairs up with the other to give you a one 1. That is why we mark those particular indices as true and false. Notice that in our variable `sum` we would have counted them individually, making `sum = 4` when in fact it should be 2 since we only take one of them from two pairs. If we have even occurrence of any number, they would be false, meaning we don't need to account them in the `diff` calculation. Now coming to `diff` how do we compute it? First we have the `seen` array to know which elements we need to look at. If that particular index is true, then we check if it's the first element of the pair which we maintain via the boolean value `firstElemOfPair`. If its true, then `first` becomes that value. Otherwise, we know that we're looking at the second element so we update the `diff` which is basically that value subtract `first`. Notice that if we look at a pair in our example as (2,4), we would pick 2 and the `diff` would be 2. This needs to be subtracted from our `sum`, hence the reason to maintain both of them. At the end, we finally subtract sum and diff and divide the result by 2 because we were doubling our diff's too.

```java
public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
      boolean[] seen = new boolean[20001];
      int sum = 0;
      for (int n: nums) {
          seen[n + 10000] = !seen[n+10000];
          sum += n;
      }
      int diff = 0;
      int first = 0;
      boolean firstElemOfPair = true;
      for (int i = 0; i < seen.length; ++i) {
          if (seen[i]) {
              if (firstElemOfPair)
                  first = i;
              else
                  diff += i-first;
              firstElemOfPair = !firstElemOfPair;
          }
      }
      return (sum-diff)/2;
  }

### [Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)<a name="swap-nodes-in-pairs"></a>

Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Swap Nodes in Pairs.

Memory Usage: 34.5 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Swap Nodes in Pairs.

The idea is simple. We add a dummy node in front for simplicity as it allows us to generalize the concept of getting two nodes at a time. We maintain a current pointer that points to the node in the actual LinkedList. Then, we get it's next and it's next.next and store it into n1 and n2. Now notice that before making n2's next = n1, we need to store n2's next into n1's next. After we do that, we need to make sure that current's next is n2 which is now working with the actual LinkedList. Then, we need to make sure that current.next.next is n1 which we just fixed and update current which is basically n1.

```java
public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode curr = dummy;
    while (curr.next != null && curr.next.next != null) {
        ListNode n1 = curr.next;
        ListNode n2 = n1.next;
        n1.next = n2.next;
        curr.next = n2;
        curr.next.next = n1;
        curr = curr.next.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
}

### [Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)<a name="generate-parentheses"></a>

Iterative Approach 1: This one is very slow.

Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 8.87% of Java online submissions for Generate Parentheses.

Memory Usage: 36.1 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Generate Parentheses.

The idea is simple. We basically do a BFS and keep track of the parentheses combination we have obtained so far. Poll the queue and check if it's length is 2*n (for a given n, we would have # of open brackets = # of closed brackets), add it to the list and check next combination. If not, then check if we can add an open bracket, add it and update number of open bracket count and add this combination to the queue. Then try to see if we can add a closed bracket, if you can add it, then update closed bracket count add that combination to the queue. Keep doing this until the queue becomes empty. This is the first approach I came up with which is naive as you can see since it's doing an exhaustive search for all valid combination.

```java
private class Node {
    private String data;
    private int open;
    private int close;

    Node(String s, int o, int c) {
        data = s;
        open = o;
        close = c;
    }
}

public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
    List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
    Queue<Node> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.add(new Node("(", 1, 0));
    while (!q.isEmpty()) {
        Node u = q.poll();
        if (u.data.length() == 2*n)
            list.add(u.data);
        else {
            Node n1 = new Node(u.data, u.open, u.close);
            Node n2 = new Node(u.data, u.open, u.close);
            if (n1.open < n) {
                n1.data = u.data + '(';
                ++n1.open;
                q.add(n1);
            }
            if (n2.close < u.open) {
                n2.data = u.data + ')';
                ++n2.close;
                q.add(n2);
            }
        }
    }
    return list;
}
```

Recursive Solution 2: This one is much more faster. I generalized the above idea into the fact that I am adding only valid combinations and any invalid combinations are automatically discarded. The logic is as follows: We know for a given n, the string length should be 2*n. So that forms our base case for recursion, if the length of String `s` is `2n`, we want to add it to the list. Otherwise, we check if the number of open brackets we have so far is less than `n`. If so, we can add an open bracket. Then check if number of close bracket is less than `open`, if so that sequence would be valid and add a close bracket and recurse.

###[Distribute Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies/)<a name="distribute-candies"></a>

Pretty simple solution. We want to give maximize the number of unique candies to give to the sister. So we maintain a hashset to collect all the unique candies first. Both of them get half the candies, so let `s = number of candies they get`. Now, if the size of the set is greater than or equal to `s`, then the sister only gets `s` candies out of it. Otherwise, the maximum amount of unique candies she can get is equal to the set size.

```java
public int distributeCandies(int[] candies) {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(candies.length);
    for (int i: candies)
        set.add(i);
    int share = candies.length/2;
    return set.size() >= share ? share: set.size();
}

### [Maximum subproduct subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)<a name="maximum-subproduct-subarray"></a>

Credits for this simplistic solution to LeetCode user [mzchen](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/discuss/48230/Possibly-simplest-solution-with-O(n)-time-complexity). The approach is very clever. Notice that if this problem was about finding maximum sum subarray, then a negative number would break the contiguous array. Here, what it does is that it makes our maximum product minimum when we see a negative number and vice versa. We keep track of maximum and minimum we have so far and check if we have a negative number. If so swap our max and min. Then, find the local maximum and minimum between current number and multiplying that number with our current max or min. After that, update our global max value and keep doing this for all values in the array.

```java
public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
    int max = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1, imax = max, imin = max; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] < 0) {
            int temp = imax;
            imax = imin;
            imin = temp;
        }

        imax = Math.max(nums[i], imax * nums[i]);
        imin = Math.min(nums[i], imin * nums[i]);
        max = Math.max(max, imax);
    }
    return max;
}

Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 95.45% of Java online submissions for Binary Tree Right Side View.

Memory Usage: 36.3 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Binary Tree Right Side View.

This is an interesting problem cause initially, I thought we would always have a complete binary tree and I made my initial solution oriented towards it. But then I saw that it doesn't say that anywhere and it could be any kind of binary tree. So it got me thinking towards a more generalized approach. Notice that to get a right side view of the binary tree, we only need the last value at any given level and put it into the list. So we maintain a queue and also the number of elements we enqueue at each stage. Initially, we put the root node in our queue and our enqueue count is 1. We dequeue exactly that many elements and again enqueue each of those dequeued node's children. Notice that I am using the variable `newEnqueued` to keep track of newly enqueued elements. Lastly, we need to check if we dequeued the last element. If so, that must be a part of the solution since it has to be the rightmost element at that level, so I add it to the list. Update `enqueued` to the new value and repeat until our queue isn't empty.

```java
public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    if (root == null)
        return list;
    Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.add(root);
    int enqueued = 1;
    while (!q.isEmpty()) {
        int newEnqueued = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < enqueued; ++i) {
            TreeNode u = q.poll();
            if (u.left != null) {
                q.add(u.left);
                ++newEnqueued;
            }
            if (u.right != null) {
                q.add(u.right);
                ++newEnqueued;
            }
            if (i == enqueued-1)
                list.add(u.val);
        }
        enqueued = newEnqueued;
    }
    return list;
}

Logic is same as your In-Order traversal of any Binary Tree, but store the node values you visit in any data structure. Here I am using an ArrayList for storing each of the visited node's value. Maintain `idx` value to keep track of which value to return. `hasNext()` method returns true as long as `idx < list.size()`.

```java
class BSTIterator {
    
    private List<Integer> list;
    private int idx = 0;

    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        list = new ArrayList<>();
        traverse(root);
    }
    
    private void traverse(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null)
            return;
        traverse(node.left);
        list.add(node.val);
        traverse(node.right);
    }
    
    /** @return the next smallest number */
    public int next() {
        return list.get(idx++);
    }
    
    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return idx != list.size();
    }
}

### [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)<a name="find-peak-element"></a>

This question was asked to me for my internship at Yahoo! The idea is simple, we want any one of the peak. So to achieve `O(log n)` time, we have to mimic binary search algorithm. We look at the middle element and check it's neighbor, if it's greater than the middle element, then we know we will have atleast one peak on the right side. Why? Think what could happen. We know that the element next to middle is greater than it, so there are two possibilities on the right side, either elements keep increasing to the right of the middle's next element or we might go up till a particular index and then go down. So in any case, we will have a peak on the right side. On the other case, if the element on the right side is smaller than the middle, then we know that the left half including the middle will have the peak cause middle is already greater than middle's right, so we might have middle as the peak itself.

```java
public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 1)
        return 0;
    int low = nums[0], high = nums.length - 1, mid;
    while (low < high) {
        mid = (low + high)/2;
        if (nums[mid] < nums[mid+1])
            low = mid+1;
        else
            high = mid;
    }
    return low;
}

Memory Usage: 40.3 MB, less than 47.00% of Java online submissions for Next Permutation.

This one was quite interesting in the sense it seems difficult but is very simple once you try out a few example. If we want to find the next lexicographical greater number, then we need to find a particular index from the right side of the array such that the number after it is greater than itself, because by swapping them would give us a next larger number. So what I first do is find the index of the number such that `num[idx] > num[idx-1]`. We know at this point that all the numbers after that index are reverse sorted, so we need to fix it and sort them in increasing order because lexicographical order demands all the numbers in increasing manner. Example, say `nums = [2,3,1,4,2,1,0]`. You can see that that the next number should be `[2,3,2,0,1,1,4]`. Notice that I replaced the number at index 2 with the first number which is greater than it if the array after index 2 was sorted. This gaurantees us a larger lexicographical number. So the first while loop finds us that index number and then I reverse the array after it. Once you reverse it, we should expect the `nums` array to look like `[2,3,1,0,1,2,4]`. Note that now we need to find the number larger than the number at index 2, which is 1 in this case. The first number greater than 1 is 2, so the second while loop finds it and then we simply swap them to give us the next larger lexicographically greater number => `[2,3,2,0,1,1,4].`

```java
public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length < 2)
        return;
    int idx = nums.length-1;
    while (idx > 0 && nums[idx] <= nums[idx-1])
        --idx;
    reverse(nums, idx);
    if (idx == 0)
        return;
    int val = nums[idx-1];
    int i = idx;
    while (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= val)
        ++i;
    swap(nums, i, idx-1);
}

private void swap(int[] arr, int idx1, int idx2) {
    int temp = arr[idx1];
    arr[idx1] = arr[idx2];
    arr[idx2] = temp;
}

private void reverse(int[] arr, int start) {
    int end = arr.length-1;
    while (start < end)
        swap(arr, start++, end--);
}
```

### [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)<a name="search-in-rotated-sorted-array"></a>

The idea is same as binary search except you need to keep track of which half to stay in. We compute the middle index and the value at that index. If the middle value is the target, then return that index. Otherwise, find the correct half. If the number on the left side is < middle value then we know that between the left and middle index, values are increasing. We only need to now check if target is < middle value, if so we need to adjust our right pointer otherwise adjust the left pointer. If left value is not < middle value then we are at a shift where the array is pivoted. We again need to confirm now which half to take. There would be some index `i` such that `nums[left] > nums[i] < nums[mid]` and value are increasing upto `i` and shifts from index `i` onwards. In this case, we again need to adjust our index pointers and we repeat this loop until `left <= right`

```java
public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right)/2;
        int midVal = nums[mid];
        if (target == midVal)
            return mid;
        else if (nums[left] <= midVal) {
            if (target < midVal && target >= nums[left])
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                left = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            if (target > midVal && target <= nums[right])
                left = mid+1;
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### [Transpose Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-matrix/)<a name="transpose-matrix"></a>

Pretty straightforward. Create matrix B of opposite dimensions to those of A. We maintain `br` and `bc` which tracks row and columns of B. We iterate over each element of A and put it in `B[br][bc]` and then ideally we would increment `bc` for an exact copy, but since we want transpose, we increment `br` and then reset it to 0 if we fill all the values in a row and increment column count, giving us the tranpose of the matrix.

```java
public int[][] transpose(int[][] A) {
    int[][] B = new int[A[0].length][A.length];
    int br = 0, bc = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < A.length; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < A[0].length; ++j) {
            B[br][bc] = A[i][j];
            if (++br == B.length) {
                br = 0;
                ++bc;
            }
        }
    }
    return B;
}
```

### [Merge K Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/submissions/)<a name="merge-k-sorted-lists"></a>

This was an onsite interview question at ThousandEyes. The idea is simple. Basically, we have multiple sorted lists so we have access to one value at a time, that is head of the lists initially and the consecutive nodes. So we need to fetch the minimum element out of all of them in constant time. The easiest way for us to do this is to use a PriorityQueue and define the logic of comparision of two ListNodes. Then, we add all the nodes inside the PQ and build our resulting List. Fetch the minimum valued ListNode and add it to our list. Then we also need to update that particular list's head, so we  add that list's next in the PQ so the next time it is fetched, we fetch the correct node of the list. Repeat this until the list is empty and return dummy's next node.

```java
public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
    if (lists.length == 0)
        return null;
    PriorityQueue<ListNode> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(lists.length, (n1, n2) -> n1.val - n2.val);
    for (ListNode ln: lists)
        if (ln != null)
            pq.add(ln);
    if (pq.isEmpty())
        return null;
    ListNode node = new ListNode(-1);
    ListNode ret = node;
    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        node.next = pq.poll();
        node = node.next;
        if (node.next != null)
            pq.add(node.next);
    }

    return ret.next;
}
```

### [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/submissions/)<a name="palindrome-number"></a>

Very elegant solution I found through the [forums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlTk8wM48ww). I had my implementation of this problem but was only 90% faster so in order to get the best answer, I searched and understood the following solution.

The `if` condition checks for edge cases. Negative numbers cannot be palindrome or any number that ends with a 0 cannot be one either.

The main idea is that if a number is palindrome, then we can divide the original number into half, reverse it and compare it with the other half. They both should be same in order for it to be a palindrome.

**Example 1:** `x = 1221`. In this case, our two halves are `12` and `21`. We reverse the second half giving us `12`. But how do we do that? We simply use modulus operator to extract the last digit and keep adding it to our `half` variable which acts like the sum. Note that we need to multiply half by 10 each time in order to construct a proper number with correct digits at ones, tens or hundreds place. Now, once we reverse the halfs, just compare the remaining of `x` and see if it is equal to `half` or not. 

But what if our number has odd digits? That is where the second condition in the `return` statement comes in handy.

**Example 2:** `x = 12321`. We construct `half` as above and we get `half = 123` and `x = 12` at which point we exit the loop. Now, since we have unequal halves, remember that in a palindrome, the middle digit is basically useless since when reversed, it doesn't change its position. So all we need is to remove that number by dividing it with 10. So our `half` is not 12 and `x` is also 12.

```java
public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
    if (x < 0 || (x != 0 && x % 10 == 0)) {
			return false;
		}

		int half = 0;
		while (x > half) {
			half = (half * 10) + (x % 10);				// Extract the last digit and add it to half * 10
			x /= 10;															// Remove the last digit from x
		}
		return x == half || x == half / 10;
}
```

## [Summary Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/)<a name="summary-ranges"></a>

```python
def summaryRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    idx = 0
    end_idx = len(nums)
    while idx < end_idx:
        start = nums[idx]
        while (idx < end_idx-1) and (nums[idx+1] - nums[idx] == 1):
            idx += 1
        end = nums[idx]
        idx += 1
        result.append(f'{start}->{end}' if start != end else f'{start}')
    return result
```

The logic for this is simple. I start from the beginning of the list and continue exploring further down the list as long as I have consecutive numbers (checked if the difference between the current and the next number is 1). If so, keep increasing the index till the next number is not a consecutive one. Record the start and end points of that range, but do check if it's a singleton (meaning that the number next to our start is not a consecutive one in which case there is no range). Pay attention to the index range being used in the outer `while` loop and in the inside `while` loop. The outer loop must consider all numbers while the inside loop must stop one short of the length of numbers to ensure we don't run out of bounds. This is a single pass algorithm so it has `O(n)` runtime.

### [Find the sum of encrypted integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-sum-of-encrypted-integers/)<a name="find-the-sum-of-encrypted-integers"></a>

```python
def sumOfEncryptedInt(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        power, max_digit = 0, 0
        while num:
            digit = num % 10
            num = num // 10
            power = power * 10 + 1
            max_digit = max(digit, max_digit)
        result += power * max_digit
    return result
```

There is a subtle detail here that is very easy to miss and also the genius part of this solution. Conventional logic dictates that we would find the max digit, record how many digits there were in the number and then start multiplying the max digit with powers of 10 for however many digits we get. For example, if our number is 523, our `max_digit = 5` and `exponent=3`. So we would do something like 5\*10^0 + 5\*10^1 + 5\*10^2 = 5 + 50 + 500 = 555. Instead of doing that, all we want is the max digit in all places. So how about we build up the number in such a way that we have 1's everywhere and that is what line 12 is doing and the subtle part of the solution. In our example of 523, our `mul` at the end of the while loop is actually 111 (replaced all digits with just 1's) and after that, we are guaranteed to have our max digit, so just multiply 111 with 5 to get 555.



### [All elements in Two Binary Search Trees]( https://leetcode.com/problems/all-elements-in-two-binary-search-trees/description/)<a name="all-elements-in-two-binary-search-trees"></a>

#### Naive approach

Use two lists and do an in-order traversal for both the trees, storing values as you traverse in each respective list. Now, use the same idea from Merge-Sort to merge the two sorted lists. This will give you an `O(m+n)` time complexity with `O(m+n)` space because you need additional data structures to hold all the elements.

#### Optimizations

We can improve the storage by a factor of one whole tree. To do this, we will use a `LinkedList` as a queue where we will first traverse the first tree in order and store all values as we see in this list. This queue will contain all values from the first tree in sorted order. Good! Now, we just need to perform in-order traversal on the second tree but taking care of the values that we see.

Let's say the queue looks like `[-1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6]` and the left-most node in the second tree is a 0.

So, our queue is sorted and we know we will be visiting the second tree in ascending order too. Save up space by just making decisions now. We see `-1` and `0` both are less than or equal to second tree node value. So take them out of the queue and put it in `result` list. Now, we will put the 0 from the second tree node also inside result so we can move on one step higher in the recursion stack. This will again compare that node's value with the value in front of our queue. If it's bigger, then we need to dequeue from the front till we get closed to the new node value now. 

Think of it like this. Using the first tree, we build an ascending queue of numbers like `[-1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6]` and then looking at each value of the tree, we see where we can place it in the series. So suppose the second tree has these values (arrange them from left to right in a binary tree) `[5, 2, 7, 1, 4, 6]`. The root of the tree is 5 and it's left child is 2, right child 7. 2's left child is 1 and right child is 4. 7's left child is 6. The in-order traversal would yield these values one by one `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. So we take the first value and see where does it fit in the queue. After the 2nd index element, 1. So remove -1, 0 and 1 from the series into a result list. Add our current node value 1, and we move to 2 now. Our queue is now `[2, 5, 6]`. We see a 2 next from the second tree. We dequeue all smaller or equal to 2 elements from our queue into result list and then put the node value, so out result looks like `[-1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]` and our queue has `[5]` in it now.

**Benefit**: We are halving our runtime and space requirements

1. Instead of the two extra lists for storing both trees, we use one queue to store only the first tree
2. We only iterate `(m + n)` times, equal to the number of nodes. In the naive approach, we had to iterate `2(m+n)` times, once to add all elements of the tree and then again (m+n) time to merge them

The new runtime is `O(m+n)` and space storage is `O(m)`

```java
public List<Integer> getAllElements(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        var queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        var result = new LinkedList<Integer>();

        traverse1(queue, root1);
        traverse2(queue, result, root2);
        result.addAll(queue);

        return result;
    }
		
		// traverse the first tree in-order to store the values inside the queue
    private void traverse1(LinkedList<Integer> queue, TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        traverse1(queue, node.left);
        queue.offer(node.val);
        traverse1(queue, node.right);
    }

		// traverse the second tree in-order but comparing values to the queue
    private void traverse2(LinkedList<Integer> queue, List<Integer> result, TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        traverse2(queue, result, node.left);
      	// while queue has values smaller than our node, dequeue them
        // and put inside the result list; this ensure we purge all small
        // values than the current node value
        while (!queue.isEmpty() && queue.peek() <= node.val) {
            result.add(queue.poll());
        }
        // Now we can put in the current node's val since we put in everything smaller
        // than it is already; do the same for the right side of the tree
        result.add(node.val);
        traverse2(queue, result, node.right);
    }
```



### [Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/)<a name="binary-tree-preorder-traversal"></a>

```java
public List<Integer> preorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    traverse(result, root);
    return result;
}

private void traverse(List<Integer> list, TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return;
    }
    list.add(node.val);
    traverse(list, node.left);
    traverse(list, node.right);
}
```

Pretty simple and straightforward. Add the node's value. Then traverse left side and then right side. 

### [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)<a name="sort-colors"></a>

This is a very dumb way to do things. This is essentially just counting sort. We have three things to keep track of, so count how many red, whites and blue are there in the box. Then just overwrite `nums` with `0's` first equal to the number of red count. Do the same for white and then blue. Tada! It's sorted in place.

- Runtime: 0ms, beats 100%
- Space: 41.69MB, beats 96.34%

But of course, this is not in the spirit of the problem. We have to really do it in place, not just tricks like this.

```java
public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
    int white = 0;
    int red = 0;
    int blue = 0;
    for (int i: nums) {
        if (i == 0) {
            red++;
        }
        else if (i == 1) {
            white++;
        }
        else {
            blue++;
        }
    }
    int idx = 0;
    while (red-- != 0) {
        nums[idx++] = 0;
    }
    while (white-- != 0) {
        nums[idx++] = 1;
    }
    while (blue-- != 0) {
        nums[idx++] = 2;
    }
}
```

The actual way to do this is using three pointers. We will collect all reds on the left side of the array, all blue balls on the right side and eventually, all whites will collect in the middle. Traverse through the `nums` array. If you see a red ball, then swap it with the white pointer but increment both red and white pointer. If you see a white ball, then just increment the white pointer. If you see a blue ball, then swap it with the blue pointer and decrement it to prepare for the next blue ball swap.

```java
public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
  	// white pointer is used to iterate over the balls, like current pointer
    int white = 0;
  	// red pointer to keep track of where to insert red balls
    int red = 0;
  	// index where blue balls go
    int blue = nums.length - 1;
    while (white <= blue) {
      	// if we see a red ball, then move it at the red pointers position
      	// swap the red pointer value with white pointer
        if (nums[white] == 0) {
            int w = nums[white];
            nums[white] = nums[red];
            nums[red] = w;
            white++;
            red++;
        }
      	// if it's a white ball, then just move ahead,
        else if (nums[white] == 1) {
            white++;
        }
      	// it's a blue ball, so move it where blue balls are being gathered
      	// swap blue and white pointer balls.
        else {
            int b = nums[blue];
            nums[blue] = nums[white];
            nums[white] = b;
            blue--;
        }
    }
}
```
