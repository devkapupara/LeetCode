# LeetCode Solutions
A Markdown file that contains my solutions of LeetCode problems, with comments so everyone can understand my thought process and the logic. The solutions file will contain optimal solution, plus any other different method that I came up with that differs from the published LeetCode solution. I have set up a script that will automatically update the the markdown file with each problem I solve, so please check back frequently if you cannot find some problems.
